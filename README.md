My name is Andreina M Fleitas C and my professional journey has been marked by a commitment to excellence, whether it’s creating comprehensive documentation deliverables or managing the supplier’s ordering activity in an e-commerce company.
As a native Spanish speaker and professionally fluent in English, I bring a dual linguistic capability essential to today’s global talent landscape. My grasp of Agile methodology strengthens my time management, writing, data entry, analysis, and problem-solving skills, which I combine with my leadership, teamwork, planning, and organizing skills.
 In my most recent role at Smartmatic, I was responsible for maintaining the Quality Management System, ensuring compliance with ISO 9001:2015 standards, and supporting the Quality Coordinator with various administrative tasks. I have also worked with stakeholders to understand the functionality of the product and or process for content creation such as user guides, user manuals, process manuals, procedures, work instructions, and forms. 
Previously, as a Dispatch Executive at EKE S.R.L., I honed my skills in updating shipping orders, tracking orders from suppliers to the shipping warehouse team, and assisting the shipping team with various operational tasks. My attention to detail was critical in responding to queries related to products and deliveries from the shipping team, ensuring impeccable service delivery.
 As a Systems & Organization Leader, I created and updated our in-house software's comprehensive User Guides and How-to Tutorials. I also played a crucial role in establishing a new governance management model by researching CMS systems for content preservation and publication.
